# Crop-Recommendation
This project is a Crop Recommendation System designed to help farmers make informed decisions about which crops to plant based on various environmental factors. The system uses machine learning techniques to analyze data and provide recommendations tailored to specific conditions.

Features:
Predictive Modeling: Uses machine learning algorithms to predict the best crops based on input features such as soil type, climate, and historical data.
User Input: Allows users to input various parameters like soil pH, temperature, and rainfall to receive crop recommendations.
Data Visualization: Provides visual insights into the recommended crops and their suitability based on the entered parameters.
Recommendation Engine: Generates a list of recommended crops with additional information about their optimal growing conditions.
Technologies Used:
Python: For developing the machine learning models and backend logic.
Scikit-learn: For implementing and training machine learning algorithms.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations and handling large datasets.
Flask: For creating a web interface to interact with the recommendation system.
HTML & CSS: For designing the front-end interface of the application.
